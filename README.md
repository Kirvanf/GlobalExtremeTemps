# GlobalExtremeTemps
This project parses the HTML of a website displaying the temperatures around the world. It uses Jsoup, an HTML parser for Java. It goes through the 436 cities displayed on the page and stores the current high and low in a class called cityweather, which consists of the name of the city and temperature. At the end of the list it displays the highest and lowest temperature around the world.
